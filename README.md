**Computational Linear Algebra (Matrix Inversion in Linear Regression)**
---
Linear regression is a powerful and widely used statistical technique that allows us to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. At its core, linear regression seeks to find the best-fitting line through a set of data points, minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. This best-fit line can be used for prediction, inference, and understanding the underlying patterns in the data.
