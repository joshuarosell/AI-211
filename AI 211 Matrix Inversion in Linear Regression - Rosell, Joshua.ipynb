At its core, linear regression seeks to find the best-fitting line through a set of data points, minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. This best-fit line can be used for prediction, inference, and understanding the underlying patterns in the data.\n","  <br/>\n","  <br/>\n","  In the realm of linear algebra, the process of finding the best-fitting line in linear regression can be elegantly expressed and solved using matrix operations. One of the most efficient methods for solving linear regression is through matrix inversion, specifically by applying the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach. This method leverages the power of matrix algebra to derive a closed-form solution for the coefficients that define the best-fitting line.\n","  <br/>\n","  <br/>\n","  The key advantage of using matrix inversion in linear regression lies in its computational efficiency and clarity.
